# DiabApp

#### App available at [heroku](https://diabetic-app.herokuapp.com/login) <br />

## Goal
DiabApp it's my own web app for diabetics.
My goal was to create simple service where diabetics could save their measurements.
Why simple? I am a diabetic myself, I used many application and never used most of their functions.
Here I focused on main purpose of those apps, adding blood sugar level and injected insulin.

## Technologies
Application was written using Java with Spring Boot and Vaadin frameworks.
Vaadin is responsible for fronted part and Spring for backend.
For development purpose in-memory H2DB is used, and it communicates with app via Spring Data Jpa.

## Launch
You can run project locally or go to [heroku](https://diabetic-app.herokuapp.com/login) to see deployed app.
In case after login you see error just reload page.
